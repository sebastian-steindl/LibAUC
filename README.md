LibAUC
======

Description
-----------

AN END-TO-END MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY FOR AUC OPTIMIZATION.

Why is LibAUC?
---------------
Deep AUC Maximization (DAM) is a paradigm for learning a deep neural network by maximizing the AUC score of the model on a dataset. There are several benefits of maximizing AUC score over minimizing the standard losses, e.g., cross-entropy.

- In many domains (e.g., medical diagonosis) the AUC score is the default metric for evaluating and comparing different methods. Directly maximizing AUC score can potentially lead to the largest improvement in the modelâ€™s performance.Many real-world datasets are usually imbalanced (e.g., the number of malignant cases is usually much less than benign cases). AUC is more suitable for handling imbalanced data distribution since maximizing AUC aims to rank the predication score of any positive data higher than any negative data

Purpose of this package
-----------------------

The idea behind this package is to use the same code as in
https://github.com/yzhuoning/libauc using the very convenient pip command

How to install
--------------

::

   pip install libauc

Example
-------

1. Download https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm/blob/master/heart_scale
   file.
2. Run the following commands

::

   >>> from libsvm.svmutil import *
   >>> y, x = svm_read_problem('path/to/heart_scale')
   >>> m = svm_train(y[:200], x[:200], '-c 4')
   *.*
   optimization finished, #iter = 257
   nu = 0.351161
   obj = -225.628984, rho = 0.636110
   nSV = 91, nBSV = 49
   Total nSV = 91
   >>> p_label, p_acc, p_val = svm_predict(y[200:], x[200:], m)
   Accuracy = 84.2857% (59/70) (classification)
