LibAUC
======
An end-to-end machine learning library for auc optimization.


Why is LibAUC?
---------------
Deep AUC Maximization (DAM) is a paradigm for learning a deep neural network by maximizing the AUC score of the model on a dataset. There are several benefits of maximizing AUC score over minimizing the standard losses, e.g., cross-entropy.

- In many domains, AUC score is the default metric for evaluating and comparing different methods. Directly maximizing AUC score can potentially lead to the largest improvement in the modelâ€™s performance.
- Many real-world datasets are usually imbalanced . AUC is more suitable for handling imbalanced data distribution since maximizing AUC aims to rank the predication score of any positive data higher than any negative data

How to install
--------------
```
$ pip install libauc
```

Example
-------
Plase run the following commands or check the example code `train_cifar10_demo.ipynb`.

```shell
$ python
```
```python
>>> #import library
>>> from libauc.losses import AUCMLoss
>>> from libauc.optimizers import PESG
...
>>> #define loss
>>> model = model.cuda()
>>> Loss = AUCMLoss()
>>> optimizer = PESG(imratio=0.1)
...
>>> #training
>>> model.train()    
>>> for data, targets in trainloader:
>>>	data, targets  = data.cuda(), targets.cuda()
        preds = model(data)
        loss = Loss(preds, targets)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward(retain_graph=True)
        optimizer.step()
...	
>>> #restart stage
>>> optimizer.update_regularizer()		
...   
>>> #evaluation
>>> model.eval()    
>>> for data, targets in testloader:
	data, targets  = data.cuda(), targets.cuda()
        preds = model(data)
